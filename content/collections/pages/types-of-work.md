      Permanent
      Employment
    content: 'Permanent employment is an employment relationship where an individual works for an employer with a guaranteed number of hours every week. This type of employment arrangement does not include a set end date. A permanent employee may work on a part-time or full-time basis. Permanent employees often receive benefits packages through their employers, though those benefits may differ based on their status as a full- or part-time employee.'

      Temporary employees are contracted workers who perform a job for only a short amount of time. Regeine will provide support in finding you temp work, we also have a candidate portal where you can sign in and see new positions updated daily.

      Temporary employment is different from other hired positions because of the job's shortened time-frame. However, in some cases, companies use temporary employment as a trial position. Temp workers can also use the job to find out more about a business before committing a full-time employee.

      Some professionals choose temporary or "gig" employment based on their talents. Jobs in creative arts like film production or photography often fit this category. Taking a gig job allows a professional to pursue flexible employment or project-based opportunities.

    title: Internships
    content: |-
      Imagine if you had the chance to give your future a trial run. What if you could test out concepts you’ve learned on campus in a professional context? Picture the doors that might open if you could meet and ask questions to experts working in jobs that you might like to have yourself one day. The great news is you can – through an internship.

      Our internships act like bridges between university study and your future work life, they help you gain professional experience, form relationships with people working in your field, and even meet potential employers.

      The most common length for an internship is 8-12 weeks, and they often take place over the summer holidays (November - February). However, some internships may be longer or take place at other times throughout the year.
