      Plan & Customise
      Your CV

    title: 'Be Confident'
    content: 'Apply for jobs you are interested in even if you only meet some of their requirements.

If you meet a portion of a job’s qualifications but believe you can still succeed in that role, apply. Include examples of your work ethic and ability to learn new skills in your resume. Emphasize how your goals align with those of the company.'
