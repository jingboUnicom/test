title_e: 'Cover Letter Tips:'
content_e: |-
  1. Your cover letter is a way the employer will get their first impression of you. It should highlight how well you communicate, a brief rundown of your experience/qualifications and show some personality.
  2. Tailor the cover letter to target the employer and position you are applying for.
  3. Make it clear and to the point.
  4. Don’t make it more than one page, unless the employer has asked otherwise.
  5. Talk about what you can do for the employer.
  6. Triple check your cover letter before sending for any typos or errors.
